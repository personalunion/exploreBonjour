# exploreBonjour

Exploring Bonjour/ZeroConf devices with Qt 5.
Finds mDNS-devices in network, resolves them and saves the result
to an elasticsearch database.

The browser and the resolver were taken from the ZeroConf Example
(http://doc.qt.io/archives/qq/qq23-bonjour.html) 
and were modified.

Feel free to commit and improve.
